Then the projective space of $V$, $\\mathbf{P}(V)$, is defined as the set of equivalence classes of $V \\setminus { 0 }$ under the relation $x \\sim \\lambda x$.\nTensor algebra\nLet $V$ be a vector space. We define the set of $k\\text{-vectors}$ using the bilinear tensor product $\\otimes$:\n$$\\mathbf{T}_k(V) = { \\x_1 \\otimes \\x_2 \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\x_k~|~x_i \\in V }.$$\nNote that $\\mathbf{T}_0 = \\mathbb{R}$, and $\\mathbf{T}_1 \\sim V$.\nThe tensor algebra $\\mathbf{T}(V)$ is the direct sum of all such sets:\n$$\\mathbf{T}(V) \\equiv \\bigoplus_k \\mathbf{T}_k(V).$$\nExterior algebra\nThe exterior algebra is a quotient algebra of the tensor algebra. We set all elements of the form $\\x \\oplus \\x \\equiv 0$, where $\\x \\in V$.\n.\nWe define the tensor product in the quotient space as the wedge product. We write:\n$$(\\x_1 \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\x_k) \\wedge (\\y_1 \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\y_m).$$\n\n\nThe wedge product is anti-symmetric on '1-vectors':\n$$0 = (\\x + \\y) \\otimes (\\x + \\y) = \\x \\oplus x + \\x \\oplus \\y + \\y \\oplus \\x + \\y \\oplus \\y = \\x \\oplus \\y + \\y \\oplus \\x .$$\nWhich implies that $\\x \\oplus \\y = -\\y \\oplus \\x$.\n\n\nThe maximum grade of vectors in the exterior algebra is equal to the dimension of the vector space $n$. We can use asymmetry and the vanishing of $\\x \\oplus \\x$ to put elements in a canonical form:\n$$\\alpha \\e_{i_1} \\oplus \\ldots \\e_{i_k}$$\nwith $j &lt; k$ \\implies $i_j &lt; i_k$.\n\n\nThis means the exterior algebra has a finite dimension. The dimension of the subspace of $k\\text{-vectors}$ is $n \\choose k$, since we can choose that many combinations of $i_j$'s. $\\sum_{k = 1}^n {n \\choose k} = 2^n$, giving us the dimension of the exterior algebra.\nA much easier way to see this is to note each $\\e_i$ occurs (or not) independently inside the multivector $\\implies 2^n$.\n\n\nTODO This models subspaces somehow\n\n\nDual spaces\nThe dual space $V^*$ of a real vector space $V$ is the space of all functionals $X: V \\to \\mathbb{R}$. It is made into a vector space by defining:\n\n$(X + Y)(\\x) = X(\\x) + Y(\\x)$\n$\\alpha X(\\x) = \\alpha X(\\x)$\nIt is isomorphic to $V$ as witnessed by any bilinear function $b$ such that $\\forall_\\y b(\\x, \\y) , 0 \\implies \\x = 0$.\n$$\\x \\mapsto b(\\x, \\cdot),$$\nWe can write $\\x^* = b(\\x, \\cdot)$.\n\nDual exterior algebra\nThe exterior algebra also has a dual $G^(V) \\equiv G(V^)$ . TODO: 1-vectors hyperplanes?\nSylvester signature theorem\nNext we describe how to construct a family of norms on a real vector space $V$ of dimension $n$.\nGiven a bilinear symmetric function $b: V \\times V \\to \\mathbb{R}$:\n\n$b(\\x, \\y) \\equiv b(\\y, \\x)$\n$b(\\alpha \\x_1 + \\beta \\x_2, \\y) \\equiv \\alpha b(\\x_1, \\y) + \\beta b(\\x_2, \\y)$\n\nWe can define a norm $||\\x||_b = \\sqrt{|b(\\x, \\x)|}$.\nSylvester's signature theorem characterizes all such functions $b$. In this case, the theorem states:\nFor a $b$ defined as above, there exists three positive integers:\n$$n_- + n_0 + n_+ = n,$$\nand a basis ${\\e_1, \\ldots \\e_n }$ of $V$ such that\n$${ b(\\e_1, \\e_1), \\ldots, b(\\e_n, \\e_n) } ={ \\underbrace{-1, \\ldots, -1}{n{-}}, \\underbrace{0, \\ldots, 0}{n_0}, \\underbrace{1, \\ldots, 1}{n_1} }.$$\nAnd vice versa (we can construct any such $b$ for a choice of basis + choice of such integers)\nKey take away:\nPoints, lines, planes through the origin are all subspaces. Projective exterior algebras model these subspaces.\n","id":"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/blog/geometric-algebra/","title":"Projective geometric algebra (I)"},"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/blog/pybind11-plus-hana/":{"body":"Recently, I have implemented Python bindings for a number of software libraries I work on. For this, I have used the excellent pybind11, which makes it easy to provide bindings for basic C++ functions and classes. Generating bindings for functions and classes looks like this:\n// bindings for a function\nm.def(\"add\", &amp;add, \"A function which adds two numbers\");\n// bindings for a class\npy::class_&lt;Pet&gt;(m, \"Pet\").def(py::init&lt;const std::string &amp;&gt;())\n\nWhile writing these bindings, I ran into two problems for two different projects, and in both cases they lead to lengthy binding definitions with a lot of repeated code.\nProblem 1: Many aggregate data types\nOne project had a lot of aggregate data types, and generating bindings for them required repeating their fields three times: in the definition, when exposing the constructor to Python, and for defining the accessors to the fields. This will inevitably lead to frustrating maintenance work as fields get added and removed. In my case, these data types described packets that would be sent over a network connection, and they would look something like this:\nstruct SomePacket {\n  static constexpr auto desc = descriptor::some_packet;\n  int32_t id;\n  float some_payload;\n  // ... more fields\n};\n\nstruct AnotherPacket {\n  static constexpr auto desc = descriptor::another_packet;\n  int32_t id;\n  std::vector&lt;float&gt; another_payload;\n  // ... more fields\n};\n\n// ... many more\n\nOf course in reality packets typically have more than two fields. The binding code would look like this:\n  py::class_&lt;SomePacket&gt;(m, \"some_packet\")\n    .def(py::init&lt;int32_t, float&gt;())\n    .def_readwrite(\"id\", &amp;SomePacket::id)\n    .def_readwrite(\"some_payload\", &amp;SomePacket::some_payload)\n    .def_readwrite(...);\n\n  py::class_&lt;AnotherPacket&gt;(m, \"another_packet\")\n    .def(py::init&lt;int32_t, std::vector&lt;float&gt;&gt;())\n    .def_readwrite(\"id\", &amp;AnotherPacket::id)\n    .def_readwrite(\"another_payload\", &amp;AnotherPacket::another_payload)\n    .def_readwrite(...);\n\n// ... many more\nProblem 2: Templates\nA second problem is when you want to generate bindings to templates. In another project, I had many classes and functions that were generic over two parameters: one integer that defines the dimension of the object or problem, and one type parameter representing the scalar type that is used (typically float or double, but maybe in some cases half precision or even quadruple precision floats). An example class template is the following.\ntemplate &lt;int D, typename T&gt;\nclass Tensor {};\n\nGenerating bindings for these objects requires explicitly instantiating them for all the values of D and T that you want to support. This will quickly become cumbersome. Already for this single class, for a limited number of values for D and T, the binding code becomes a mess:\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;1, float&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_1d_f\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;2, float&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_2d_f\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;3, float&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_3d_f\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;4, float&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_4d_f\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;5, float&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_5d_f\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;6, float&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_6d_f\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;1, double&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_1d_d\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;2, double&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_2d_d\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;3, double&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_3d_d\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;4, double&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_4d_d\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;5, double&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_5d_d\");\npy::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;6, double&gt;&gt;(m, \"tensor_6d_d\");\nMetaprogramming to the rescue!\nWith Boost.Hana, it is possible to write concise and maintainable Python bindings for both of these problematic cases. For the uninitiated:\n\nHana is a header-only library for C++ metaprogramming suited for computations on both types and values.\n\n… and computations on types seems to be exactly what we need.\nAutomatically binding user-defined types\nFirst, let us focus on generating bindings to simple user-defined types. In order to avoid listing the (types of the) fields when generating the bindings, we need to be able to inspect our data types programmatically. This introspection of user-defined types is supported by Boost.Hana using either of two macro's.\nBOOST_HANA_DEFINE_STRUCT can be used within the original definition of a struct, or BOOST_HANA_ADAPT_STRUCT can be used outside of the original definition (if you cannot, or understandably do not want to touch the definition of your data types). In our example, this would look like this:\nstruct SomePacket {\n  static constexpr auto desc = descriptor::some_packet;\n  BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_STRUCT(SomePacket,\n    (int32_t, id),\n    (float, some_payload));\n}\n\nstruct AnotherPacket {\n  static constexpr auto desc = descriptor::another_packet;\n  BOOST_HANA_DEFINE_STRUCT(AnotherPacket,\n    (int32_t, id),\n    (std::vector&lt;float&gt;, another_payload));\n}\n\nNow, we have the possibility to loop over the members fields of our packets. This can also simplify code in other places. For example, these network packets have to be serialized, deserialized and measured for size. This can now all be implemented in a function with a one-line body!\ntemplate &lt;typename Packet, typename Buffer&gt;\nvoid fill(Packet&amp; packet, Buffer&amp; buffer) {\n    hana::for_each(packet, [&amp;](auto member) { buffer | hana::second(member); });\n}\n\nHere, Buffer is a class (serializer, deserializer, or a scale) that implements operator| for all the possible field types. However, these individual functions do not have to be implemented for each packet. With the for_each function, we are able to loop over all (name, value) pairs for the member fields of our packets.\nGoing back to the Python bindings, being able to loop over all member fields means we no longer have to explicitly list constructors and accessors. We can generate them automatically!\n// 1) list packets and the names to give to their Python bindings\nauto packets = hana::make_tuple(\n    hana::make_tuple(\"some_packet\"s, hana::type_c&lt;SomePacket&gt;),\n    hana::make_tuple(\"another_packet\"s, hana::type_c&lt;AnotherPacket&gt;),\n  // ... many more\n);\n\n    hana::for_each(packets, [&amp;](auto x) {\n        // 1) get C++ type (e.g. SomePacket)\n        using P = typename decltype(+(x[1_c]))::type;\n\n        // 2) get arguments for the constructor, as a tuple of types\n        auto types = hana::transform(hana::members(P{}), [](auto member) {\n            return hana::type_c&lt;decltype(member)&gt;;\n        });\n        // ... types is now e.g. (int32_t, float) for SomePacket\n\n        // 3) we 'unpack' this tuple inside py::init,\n        using Init = typename decltype(hana::unpack(\n            types, hana::template_&lt;py::detail::initimpl::constructor&gt;))::type;\n        // ... now Init is e.g py::init&lt;int32_t, float&gt;\n\n        // 4) register class with Python\n        auto packet = py::class_&lt;P, Packet&gt;(m, x[0_c].c_str()).def(Init());\n        // ... x[0_c] contains the python name, e.g. some_packet, and Packet is\n        // some base class.\n\n        // 5) register accessors\n        hana::fold(hana::accessors&lt;P&gt;(), std::ref(packet),\n                   [](py::class_&lt;P, Packet&gt;&amp; c,\n                      auto ka) -&gt; py::class_&lt;P, Packet&gt;&amp; {\n                       return c.def(hana::first(ka).c_str(), [&amp;ka](P&amp; p) {\n                           return hana::second(ka)(p);\n                       });\n                   });\n        // ... this may look complicated if you have not seen folds before, but\n        // this is essentially iteratively calling .def on the registered packet\n        // class. Note that we require the lambda indirection for pybind11 to\n        // recognize the member function.\n    });\n\nNow, generating bindings for a new packet is completely automatic: we only have to add it to the packets list. Also, when changing/adding/removing fields from a packet, the Python bindings are updated automatically. Neat!\nAutomatically instantiating templates\nWe can also use Boost.Hana to generate combinations of D and T in our Tensor example.\nauto ds = hana::make_tuple(\n    hana::make_tuple(\"1d\"s, 1_c), hana::make_tuple(\"2d\"s, 2_c),\n    hana::make_tuple(\"3d\"s, 3_c), hana::make_tuple(\"4d\"s, 4_c),\n    hana::make_tuple(\"5d\"s, 5_c), hana::make_tuple(\"6d\"s, 6_c));\n\nauto ts = hana::make_tuple(hana::make_tuple(\"f\"s, hana::type_c&lt;float&gt;),\n                           hana::make_tuple(\"d\"s, hana::type_c&lt;double&gt;));\n\nhana::for_each(hana::cartesian_product(hana::make_tuple(ds, ts)),\n    [&amp;](auto dt) {\n      const auto d = dt[0_c][1_c];\n      using T = typename decltype(+dt[1_c][1_c])::type;\n      auto name = \"tensor_\"s + dt[0_c][0_c].c_str() + \"_\"s +\n                  dt[1_c][0_c].c_str();\n      py::class_&lt;Tensor&lt;d, T&gt;&gt;(m, name.c_str());\n    });\nAdding named arguments to init functions\nWe can also add named arguments to the constructors. For this, we use\nhana::keys to access the field names. The pybind11 syntax for adding named arguments is:\npy::class_&lt;Class&gt;(m, \"class\")\n   .def(py::init&lt;T, S, ...&gt;, py::arg(\"arg1\"), py::arg(\"arg2\"), ...);\n\nWe therefore need to wrap our field names using py::arg, and then apply them\nas additional arguments to the def method. This can be done as follows:\nauto names = hana::transform(\n    hana::keys(P{}), [](auto key) { return py::arg(key.c_str()); });\nauto indirection = [&amp;](auto... args) {\n    auto pack = py::class_&lt;P, tomop::Packet&gt;(m, x[0_c].c_str())\n                    .def(Init(), args...);\n    return pack;\n};\nauto pack = hana::unpack(names, indirection);\nExample code\nExample source code can be found on GitHub.\n","id":"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/blog/pybind11-plus-hana/","title":"Using Boost.Hana to simplify the generation of Python bindings"}},"docInfo":{"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/":{"body":498,"title":3},"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/blog/":{"body":1,"title":0},"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/blog/geometric-algebra/":{"body":386,"title":3},"https://jwbuurlage.github.io/blog/pybind11-plus-hana/":{"body":721,"title":6}},"length":4}};
